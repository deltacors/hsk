# chinese-training
I wrote this script to help myself to study the Chinese Vocabulary.
You can loop randomly through the words from the book "Il cinese per gli Italiani vol. 1" to test your skills.
The script is in italian because the book is made for italian mother tongue people.
The wordbase is not complete because i haven't finished the book yet, but i'm going to update it everytime i make a step forward.
Have fun!
