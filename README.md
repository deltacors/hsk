# HSK hanzi training
I wrote this script to help myself to study the Chinese Vocabulary.
You can loop randomly through the words of the HSK hanzi lists.
This is not a replacement for the huge number of apps out there, in fact this script does not tell you the strokes order,  it does not provide you sample sentences or audio recordings.
It is just a quick helper to keep in training with the hanzi you have already learnt. 
The wordbase is not complete because I started to learn Chinese not so long ago, but I'm going to update it everytime I make a step forward.
Have fun!
